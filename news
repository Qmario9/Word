The LockBit ransomware gang has claimed responsibility for multiple cyberattacks, including Newark Academy in Livingston, New Jersey, which marks their 24th attack within 24 hours. The gang, affiliated with Russia, also targeted the Cross City Tunnel in Sydney, Australia, giving local officials a deadline of June 26th to pay an unspecified ransom or face consequences. Other recent victims include the Pittsburg Unified School District and a healthcare center in Fredericksburg, Virginia, in the United States, as well as a municipality in Iceland. However, the veracity of these claims has not been independently verified. LockBit is currently the most active ransomware group, with nearly 1,800 victims tracked by the DarkFeed monitoring website.
