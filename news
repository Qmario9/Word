The Chinese nation-state hacking group known as Camaro Dragon has been identified as the source of a new backdoor malware called TinyNote, which is designed for intelligence gathering. The malware is a basic payload capable of executing commands and enumerating machines. Despite its lack of sophistication, it establishes multiple methods to retain access to compromised hosts and communicates with different servers to obscure its activities. The goal is to hide malicious activity by routing communications through compromised home routers. These findings highlight the evolving evasion tactics and targeting capabilities of the attackers.  The use of TinyNote alongside other tools with different levels of sophistication suggests that the threat actors are actively diversifying their attack arsenal.
