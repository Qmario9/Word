Renowned email protection and network security provider Barracuda has issued a chilling warning about a zero-day flaw, known as CVE-2023-2868, that has been exploited to breach their own Email Security Gateway appliances. This eerie vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute system commands with terrifying precision by manipulating .tar files in incoming email attachments. Barracuda swiftly released patches to combat the threat, but evidence reveals that the flaw has been actively exploited, granting unauthorized access to a subset of the gateways. The true scale of the attack remains unknown, leaving over 200,000 customers in suspense. Barracuda has reached out to affected users with remedial actions. The origin of these malevolent actors remains a mystery, although Chinese and Russian hacking groups are suspected due to their past exploits. In a parallel tale of horror, a WordPress security company named Defiant has discovered a large-scale exploitation of a patched vulnerability called Beautiful Cookie Consent Banner, allowing unauthenticated attackers to inject malicious JavaScript and wreak havoc on websites. Defiant has valiantly defended against millions of attacks, but the battle continues, leaving numerous websites exposed to these faceless assailants.
