A security vulnerability has been uncovered in Google Cloud Platform's (GCP) Cloud SQL service, potentially enabling unauthorized access to sensitive data. Israeli cloud security firm Dig identified a multi-stage attack chain that exploited gaps in the platform's security layer associated with SQL Server. By escalating user privileges to an administrator role and taking control of the database server, an attacker could gain access to internal data, including secrets, passwords, and customer data. This breach could lead to the exposure of cloud providers' and customers' sensitive information. The issue was responsibly disclosed in February 2023 and addressed by Google in April 2023. Meanwhile, Google has introduced the Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME) API, allowing Google Cloud users to acquire and renew TLS certificates automatically and free of charge.
