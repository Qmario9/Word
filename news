Sinister packages discovered in the npm repository unleash TurkoRat, a horrifying information-stealing malware. nodejs-encrypt-agent and nodejs-cookie-proxy-agent remained hidden for two months, harvesting sensitive data like login credentials and cryptocurrency wallets. The malware disguised itself as legitimate npm modules, deceiving over 25 million downloads. This highlights the grave risk of supply chain attacks, with threat actors exploiting open-source packages. Moreover, Checkmarx reveals a disturbing tactic where attackers impersonate authentic npm packages by manipulating capitalization, making detection difficult. The trend continues with malicious extensions in the VS Code marketplace and rogue libraries in PyPI. These malevolent actors deploy backdoors, clipper malware, and even hijack Discord tokens. Perpetrators employ automated methods to maintain persistent infections. Vigilance is crucial as these threats persist and grow in sophistication, pervading the digital realm.
