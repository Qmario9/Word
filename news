The hacker group Anonymous Sudan, which has been targeting SAS Airlines, has increased its ransom demand to $10 million. The group has been intermittently attacking the SAS website and app since May 24th. The initial ransom demand of $3500 quickly escalated to $175,000 on May 25th, then to $3 million a week later. Now, the demand has been raised again to $10 million. Anonymous Sudan claims they are attacking out of boredom and have no intention of stopping until the ransom is paid. They have criticized the airline's customer service and have been unresponsive to customer complaints on social media. Anonymous Sudan previously targeted Sweden and SAS in a Valentine's Day attack over an incident in Stockholm. The group is known for DDoS attacks and is associated with other pro-Russian threat groups.
