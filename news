A previously unidentified threat actor is targeting the U.S. aerospace industry with a newly discovered PowerShell-based malware called PowerDrop. This malware utilizes advanced techniques such as deception, encoding, and encryption to avoid detection. Adlumin, the organization that discovered PowerDrop, found it embedded in a domestic aerospace defense contractor's system in May 2023. The name PowerDrop comes from the use of Windows PowerShell in creating the script and the "DROP" string in the code for padding. PowerDrop is designed as a post-exploitation tool, meaning it gathers information from compromised networks after gaining initial access through other methods. The malware uses Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) echo request messages as beacons to establish communication with a command-and-control server. The server responds with an encrypted command that is decoded and executed on the compromised host. Similarly, an ICMP ping message is employed to exfiltrate the results of the instruction. Additionally, the PowerShell command is executed using the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) service, indicating the attacker's intention to utilize living-off-the-land techniques to evade detection. Although the core structure of the threat is not particularly sophisticated, its ability to obscure suspicious activity and bypass endpoint defenses suggests the involvement of more advanced threat actors, according to Mark Sangster, Vice President of Strategy at Adlumin.
